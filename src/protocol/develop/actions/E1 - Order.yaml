#
# Order Action: Used by the administration to signal to the smart contract that the tokens that a particular public address(es) owns are to be confiscated, frozen, thawed or reconciled.
# F - Freeze tokens until freeze expires of thaw action reverses it.
# T - Thaw reverses a Freeze.
# C - Confiscate moves tokens from specified holders to a specified deposit address.
# R - Reconcile destroys tokens from specified holders to correct after a chain reorg has caused accidental creation of tokens.
